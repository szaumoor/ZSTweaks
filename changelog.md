# Changelog

## Fixes

- Fixed small typo in descriptions of Holy Words.
- Fix for small issue for compatibility with Fishing for trouble in Finesse component
- Removed super-serious warning in component 1532 since it no longer applies (install whenever, not necessarily at the very end).

## Modifications

- Misc internal fixes
- Added configuration option to make smashing wave party friendly. On by default.
- Smashing Wave component now also decreases casting time from 9 to 6
- Added otyugh attacks to component 3080, as they should not be considered magical (their mouth is full of disease, what's there to dispel or resist with magic resistance?)
- Added also a missing natural weapon of carrion crawler that wasn't being patched by component 3080
- Opened component 3080 to IWDEE

## New components

- Make Helm of Balduran to work as it does in BG3 (1366) (BGEE BG2EE EET)
  - Immunity to stun, and 2 HP/round regeneration, instead of +1 THAC0 and +5 Hit Points
- Make the effects on-hit of Otyugh attacks nonmagical and subject to saving throws (3160) (all games)
  - Save vs. Death at -2 instead of no way to prevent it beyond being immune to poison / undead / golem
