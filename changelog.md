# Changelog

## Fixes

- Added prefix: One yuan-ti creature file was using long swords without proficiency for it, resulting in them incurring in penalties. Disabled if the fixpack is installed (currently only existing in CamDawg's fork)
- Added prefix: No minotaurs in BG2 are set to minotaurs race-wise, resulting in them not being affected by opcodes that target minotaurs, such as my Maze tweak
- Added prefix: Golem Juggernaut standardized to Stone Golem
- Added prefix: Greater Clay Golem should be treated as a Clay Golem class-wise
- Added prefix: Shambling Mounds will be set as Plants and Shambling Mounds race-wise
- Added fix for Unholy Reaver for Item Upgrade not being tweaked appropriately in the Soul Reaver component.
- Fixed installation crash with Cloak of Fear component
- Excluded the part that distributes the "Remove Fear" effect for Cloak of Fear if fixpack is installed, since they do that already.

## Modifications

- Light Crossbow tweak no longer requires to be installed at the last, and becomes part of the general tweaks section.
- Merged all the components that tweak disruption weapons into a single component in the General Tweaks section. It also now includes a tweak to one of my items in my Item Pack.
- Added compatibility with my Item Pack (ZS_ItemPack) in the following way:
  - Dagger component modifies the kukris differently, granting no thac0 or critical hit bonus, half the speed bonus, but base damage is increased from 1d4 to 1d4+1
  - With Finesse:
    - Kukris have a 7% less chance of triggering a finesse hit compared to other daggers (37-45%)
    - Rapiers have a 5% less chance of triggering a finesse hit compared to other short swords (21-30%)
    - Estocs have a 4% higher chance of triggering a finesse hit compared to other long swords (10-19%)
    - No changes for shurikens
  - The new disruption component will patch Shining Light of Lathander with the new rebalanced undead-disruption effect
- Katanas and scimitars now have a 10-19% chance to trigger finesse instead of 9-18%
- Improved the implementation of the axes critical hit bonus component to allow configuration of axes and halberds independently.
- Backstab penalty component now allows configuration of the kukri, estoc, and rapier in my item pack. By default, they stay at 0 penalty, except estocs, which have a -1 penalty, which aligns with the long sword proficiency they have.
- Earthquake component now causes 5d10 crushing damage to stone and juggernaut golems once, as per PnP
- Character stats now also allows modifying the saving throws for shorty races. You can choose a toned down version, to standardize it to +2 bonus, regardless of constitution, or to nullify it entirely. Race description will not be updated for now
- Shield of Archons component modified to follow PnP slightly more closely, which provides an extra edge to the spell. First, it's renamed to Planar Shield, as "archons" are implied to be good-aligned, and evil casters would have access to Shield of the Tanar'ri instead. To generalize it, the name was changed. The spell now also provides a +4 bonus to saving throws against area effects that are not centered directly on the caster, as well as stationary area effects, or non-magical or non-absorbable effects.
- Hugely simplified the code in Shield of Archons component using CamDawg's functions (praise be to him)
- Flesh to stone component now also adds the option to lightly overhaul the Stone to Flesh spell, making it cause damage to stone golems, as per PnP.
- Armor of Faith now also includes damage reduction against Poison damage (not poisoning itself)
- Death Fog component is now closer to PnP, renamed to Acid Fog, and the banishment effect is removed. Now it deals more acid damage, reduces acid resistance, Armor Class, and physical resistances, decreases movement speed and bypasses magic resistance.
- Deleted the configuration option in Death Fog as it's no longer relevant
- Deva and Planetar components now merged in one, with appropriate configuration options to choose either or both
- Configuration file is now in **ZSTweaks/configurations**
- Added a group installation component for creature tweaks.
- *Cautiously* added the option to choose which components are installed through user input in the creatures, npc, and class/kit tweaks. See **ZSTweaks/configurations**, if you're interested and set it as per your liking.
- Fixed issue in RR's Crippling Strike component preventing the effects from being set at the wrong position in the effect stack, which prevented immunities and refreshing effects from working
- Removed the Chaotic Commands component, now an element of the prefix part of this mod (disabled if fixpack is installed)
- Added an option in the preferences file to make the component that sets backstab multiplier to 0 in BBOD and Iron Golem fist so it's only backstab multiplier reduction, as per your preferences (disabled by default)
- Improved the code in Phantom's Blade Tweak/Fix
- Moved the Phantom's Blade component into a prefix (extending headers to level 20 & marking extra damage as not waking up sleepers; former doesn't run if fixpack is installed)
- Short Sword of Mask entangle effect is now not subject to magic resistance, but can be dispelled still
- Shortened the component descriptions and improved the writing a bit
- Stats tweak now switches back to the default bonus from sword and shield +2 AC vs missile, so it's more enticing for classes that can only put a single point, beyond removing the penalties of having no proficiency
- Deleted needless files
