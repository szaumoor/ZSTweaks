# Changelog

## Fixes

- Minor text fixes
- Added description for Helm of Balduran
- Fixed shadow creature component affecting only the shadows from my shadowdancer overhaul instead of affecting all other than those, as it was intended
- Fixed some components modifying undefined amount of creatures erroneously marking files as modified even when no changes were applied to them

## Modifications

- Renamed the NPC group to the Joinable Characters group

## New components

- Make Balduran's Swords better and draw inspiration from BG3
  - Now considered +2 weapons, deals extra damage vs. all shapeshifters, +2 saving throws vs. spell merges changes of the BG2 version
  - Can be set as a long sword (both cases), standardize to bastard sword, or keep it as is, with the same stats
  - They all share the same icon (golden sword from BG1)
- Make Mold Touch a tad more powerful and convenient
- Make Plate of Balduran more effective and remove odd weird design choices
  - Becomes +3?, HP bonus increases to +10 from +4. Removed that weird minimum level 6 for its bonuses to apply.
- Make Harper Pin not forcibly only usable by Jaheira (as per the description)
- Make Keepsake Locket (Jaheira's Romance) provide some minor benefits
- Make Sword of Chaos reflect BG3's take on it
  - Healing of 1d6 per hit (max three times per round), deals 1d4 extra necrotic damage (irresistible damage that only affects the living)
