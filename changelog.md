## Modifications

- Improved the performance of some components by reducing the amount of IO operations
- The Wish version of Greater Restoration will not cause fatigue anymore.
- Night's Gift component now allows the user to cast shadowstep instantly and without any delay, similar to my shadowdancer overhaul's version, if the overhaul is installed. This benefits anyone using the armor, even if you're not using my kit overhaul in your playthrough
