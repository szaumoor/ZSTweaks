# Changelog

## Fixes

- Added compatibility bits for latest features of my shadowdancer mod
- Fixed bug with some of the components adding abilities to classes and kits injecting the abilities one level above intended

## Modifications

- New releases should now properly include and open the readme if chosen when installing. It will also now open both the base readme and the readme detailing every component. I recommend a text editor or similar application that can render markdown appropriately.
- Mod releases will now generate a Windows version, and a Linux version which simply skips the .exe since it has no use there

## New components

- Make single-classed thieves, bards, and monks able to briefly avoid damaging AoE and projectiles once per day
- Make drow's magic resistance lower (configurable)
