# Changelog

## Fixes

- Fixed installation error on 1197 due to component installation check running twice.
- Fixed readme marking component 1197 as 1997 (which doesn't exist)
- Fixed component 1608 patching Martial Staff in EET `staf08.itm`, leading to a redundancy because it copies Aule's Staff into the game as `staf08_.itm`. Thanks Graion Dilach.

## Modifications

- A few string corrections in the translation files
