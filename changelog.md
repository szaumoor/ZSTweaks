# Changelog

## Fixes

- Added prefix: Shakti's Figurine +4 short sword has a speed factor of 0 from 1
- Moved a portion of IO operations to the beginning to improve the efficiency of components that patch arbitrary numbers of NPCs
- Fixed yet another bug with the dragon disciple component: fire damage bonus was only applying to creatures, not the kit itself, leading to player-created dragon disciples to not benefit from the bonus
- Fixed bug with the blackguard backstab x2 component where the effect was not set as permanent appropriately
- Fixed component that makes throwing daggers usable as melee weapons so it installs in versions of BGEE without SoD
- Fixed component for Arrow of Fire not correctly patching the description for non-BG2EE games
- Fixed component making a check twice for no reason
- Fixed yet another bug with dragon disciple component giving them access to Horrid Wilting instead of Incendiary Cloud
- Misc code improvements

## Modifications

- Component 1545 (character stats) now allows users to specify which of the weapon styles they want to modify, if any (all on by default)
- Protection of undead modification will now not allow stacking with itself
- Added swashbucklers as another optional target for the +1/2 APR at levels 7 and 13 component
- Improved the implementation of the blackguard component that allows them to backstab x2
- Component that adds backstab penalties is now fully configurable: you can add penalties to any and all weapon types, including weapons that are not normally considered "backstab weapons", which makes it more useful in setups where the choice of weapons that can backstab is extended
- Entangle component now makes it bypass magic resistance (still dispellable)
- Entangle component now changes the saving throws required to Save vs. Breath, as it's more accurate in my estimation
- Entangle component improves the spell further, making the AC debuff -4 instead of -2, and setting their APR to 1, which mimics difficulty attacking while entangled
- Improved the implementation of Entangle component
- Potion overhaul now makes the explosive potions deal fire damage that bypasses magic resistance, as it is, as far as I can tell not magical in nature, but based on dangerous chemicals reacting violently. The wands provide a contrast to this, since they are clearly magical in nature, and thus they are affected by magic resistance
- Axe crit component now adjusted so two-handed axes deal extra damage equal to 1d10 + Bonus instead of 1d12 + Bonus, which fits the damage range in IWD for two-handed axes
- Component that sets APR for magical weapons to 2 sets it to 3/2 for classes that have fighter levels so classes that are more "purist" or not benefiting from warrior class benefits can get more out of it, and maintaining more balance. Improved code for the component as well.
- Components 1537 and 1601 to make all potions usable by everyone and not stackable with themselves merged with the potion overhaul component. Now you can use the configuration file to specify if you want the overhaul, or the usability tweak, or the self-stack tweak or any combination thereof.
- Fireball animation part of the fireballs component also patches the explosion from Dragon's Breath to be more visually appealing. Mod component's name modified accordingly: "Make fireball-type spells improve more with level and/or improve explosion animations"
- Fireball component now also raises the minimum damage to Dragon's Breath (the spell) to 40 (before saves, 20 if saved): 20d10 â‡¾ 20d9+20. This is thematically in accordance to other tweaks to powerful spells in this mod
- Planetar and Deva components now allow both to instantly cast all of their spells
