# Changelog

## Fixes

- Fix for Hexxat's Blood Drain so the cooldown works even if Hexxat is interrupted when trying to "cast" the Blood Drain


## Modifications

- Misc internal fixes
- Revised the Aule's Staff component so it patches the Martial Staff without changing its name or basic description in EET. In BG2EE it replaces the staff for Aule's Staff, because it's at least unique.
- Added minor compatibility bit between my tweak to The Visage and [The Pursuit of Justice mod by bucketfulofsunshine](https://github.com/bucketfulofsunshine/the-pursuit-of-justice) so descriptions are in line
