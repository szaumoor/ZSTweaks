@5000 = ~Glyph of Warding
(Abjuration, Evocation)

Level: 3
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

A Glyph of Warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any creature violating the warded area is subject to the magic it stores, although a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell enables the creature to take only half of the damage. When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When the glyph is activated, it deals 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the caster, up to 20d4.~

@5010 = ~Bless
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Sphere: All
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Upon uttering the Bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack and damage rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 40 ft.) the spell will be cast. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15-ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effects; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~

@5020 = ~Hold Person
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 2
Sphere: Charm
Range: 35 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemy within 4 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. This includes: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 4 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who Save vs. Spell at -1 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

@5030 = ~Finger of Death
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Finger of Death spell snuffs out the victim's life force. The caster points <PRO_HISHER> finger at the victim after the incantation is complete, effectively ripping the life out of its body unless a Save vs. Spell is made with a -2 penalty. A creature successfully making the Saving Throw still receives 2d8 points of damage + 1 per level of the caster.~


@5040 = ~Meteor Swarm
(Evocation)

Level: 9
Range: 270 ft.
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When the caster utters the words to this powerful spell, <PRO_HESHE> calls upon powerful forces indeed. These forces pull down meteors from above, hurling them randomly at anyone in the area of effect. Anyone caught in the destructive path of the meteors—whether friend or foe—will suffer 2d8 points of damage plus 1 per level of the caster (i.e. 2d10 + 1/level) with no Saving Throw. The caster is well advised to be careful in <PRO_HISHER> use of this spell.~

@5050 = ~Horror
(Enchantment)

Level: 2
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

All enemies within the area of effect when this spell is cast must save vs. Spell or flee in terror. Certain creatures are immune to the effects of fear, including all undead.~

@5060 = ~Goodberry
(Alteration, Evocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Casting a Goodberry spell creates 6 magical berries that the caster can carry with <PRO_HIMHER>. Each berry restores 2d4 Hit Points when eaten and grant a slow regeneration of 1 HP per turn for 8 hours.~

@5070 = ~Created by the Goodberry spell, these simple-looking blueberries will heal 2d4 points of damage for each handful of berries eaten and help the body heal faster for 8 hours.

STATISTICS:

Special: Heals 2d4 Hit Points and grants a regeneration of 1 HP per turn for 8 hours

Weight: 0~

@5080 = ~Negative Plane Protection
(Abjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Protection, Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell affords the caster or the touched creature partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy Plane connections (such as vampires), and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The Negative Plane Protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy Plane, possibly offsetting the effects of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is protected against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell. The protected creature suffers only normal Hit Point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience. This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy Plane.~

@5090 = ~Earthquake
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 360 ft.
Duration: 3 tremors
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, a local tremor of fairly high strength rips the ground. The shock is over in several rounds. The earthquake affects all creatures in its area of effect except the caster and <HISHER> party. There are 3 tremors that are caused by the earthquake:

 1st: All creatures affected take 6d6 points of damage and fall to the ground for 4 rounds. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -6 penalty halves the damage and negates the fall.
 2nd: All creatures affected take 3d6 points of damage. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty halves the damage.
 3rd: All creatures affected take 2d6 points of damage. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell halves the damage.

Additionally, earth elementals dislike mere mortals toying with the land and there is a small chance that casting this spell will cause an earth elemental to appear and attack the party.~

@5100 = ~Entangle
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Sphere: Plant
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of this spell, the caster is able to cause plants in the area of effect to entangle creatures within the area. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about the creatures, holding them fast. Once per round, a creature can attempt to save vs. Spell with a +2 bonus to avoid entanglement. The difficulty of the saving throw improves by 1 at level 5 and every fifth level thereafter.  An entangled creature can still attack, but receives a -2 penalty to its Armor Class.~

@5110 = ~Poison
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: 15 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

Through this spell, the caster can poison victims who fail their Saving Throw vs. Poison. The damage inflicted depends on the level of the caster as detailed below:
 7–9th level: 2d8 + 2/round
 10–12th level: 3d8 + 3/round
 13–14th level: 4d8 + 4/round
 15–16th level: 6d8 + 5/round
 17+ level: 8d8 + 6/round
Those who make their Saving Throws only take half of the initial damage, and are unaffected by the poison damage per round.~

@5120 = ~Holy Power
(Evocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Through this spell, the caster imbues <PRO_HIMHER>self with the strength and skill of a Fighter of the same level. The priest's Strength score is set to 18/00—even if it is normally higher—<PRO_HISHER> THAC0 becomes that of a Fighter of the same level, gains 1/2 APR at level 7 and another one at level 13, and <PRO_HESHE> gains 1 temporary Hit Point per level. This will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@5130 = ~Tenser's Transformation
(Alteration)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power, for when the wizard casts the spell, <PRO_HESHE> undergoes a startling transformation. The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic proportions, and <PRO_HESHE> becomes a formidable fighting machine.

The spell causes the caster to become a berserk Fighter: <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points double, and all damage <PRO_HESHE> sustains is first detracted from this magically-gained life; <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class gains a +4 bonus up to a maximum Armor Class of -10; and all <PRO_HISHER> attacks are made as though <PRO_HESHE> were a Fighter of the same level (i.e. the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved to Fighters, and extra attacks are granted). Each attack also receives a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@5140 = ~Iron Skins
(Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Druid casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the Druid in no way. The effect of this is to protect the Druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level Druid would receive 5 skins. For each skin the Druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level Druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER> but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the Druid until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell's duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the Druid from any area attacks such as Fireball; however, it will protect <PRO_HIMHER> from physical magical attacks such as Magic Missile.~

@5150 = ~Fire Seeds
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 6
Sphere: Elemental
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: 1/2

Casting the Fire Seed spell creates 10 fire seeds that will appear in the caster's inventory. The seeds will remain in existence for 3 turns after the spell is cast. If they are thrown at an enemy, a fireball will ensue, causing 3d8+5 points of damage to all within a 7-ft. radius unless they make a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage. These seeds are thrown with a THAC0 bonus of +2 and are considered +2 weapons for the purposes of what they can hit.~

@5160 = ~Created by the Fire Seeds spell. When thrown at opponents, they explode into small fireballs that do 3d8+5 points of damage to everyone within a 7-ft. radius.

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +2
Damage: 3d8+5 (Save vs. Spell for half)

Weight: 0~

@5170 = ~Nature's Beauty
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 7
Sphere: Elemental
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

When this spell is cast, the caster appears to undergo a remarkable transformation. The caster becomes the very ideal of beauty: For a male, this is usually a nymph; for a female, it varies. As with a nymph, anyone viewing the disguised caster must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with +1 bonus or die of longing for the denied illusion. Even if the Saving Throw is successful, hapless viewers of the transformed Druid are all instantly smitten with permanent blindness (until dispelled). The transformation is instantaneous, but lasts only seconds, affecting those near the caster (excluding fellow party members).~

@5180 = ~Confusion
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 7
Sphere: Chaos
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes confusion in one or more enemy creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All enemy creatures within the area of effect are allowed Saving Throws vs. Spell with a -4 penalty. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Those who fail their Saving Throws will either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell.

The spell lasts for 1 round for every two levels of the caster. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.~

@5190 = ~Symbol, Death
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 7
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Symbol, Death is a powerful enchantment that allows the priest to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until someone comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all those within the area of effect to make a Saving Throw vs. Death or die. Creatures with more than 60 current Hit Points are significantly less likely to be killed, gaining a +6 bonus to their Saving Throw.~

@5200 = ~Symbol, Death
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 8
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

Ghostly figures called by the Shaman swirl around the battlefield, tormenting the Shaman's adversaries. All enemies within the area of effect take 6d6 points of magic damage per round for the next 3 rounds (no save).

(Necromancy)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard weakens an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it.

@5250 = ~Energy Drain
(Necromancy)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining <PRO_HIMHER> of 6 levels of experience. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.~

Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orcs called this time the "Year of Pushing Too Far."

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

A Grease spell covers a material surface with a slippery, highly flamable layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell at +2 or slip and slide, unable to move effectively (80% slower). Those who successfully save can move, albeit slowly (25% slower), for the rest of the round (but will need to save vs. Spell again the following round). Regardless of whether they save against the effect or not, the oil will make them take 25% more fire damage for 1 round due to the volatile nature of the oils. Those who remain in the area are allowed a Saving Throw each round until they escape the area.

Because this spell effectively simply conjures plain grease, it's not affected by Magic Resistance.~

She became an autharch for Aznar Thrul, the tharchion of Priador. In this position, she created the Order of Eight Staves, designed to study wild magic. For years, Vicross and her underlings hunted and captured wild mages across Faerûn, performing a variety of tests on their prisoners, collecting and analyzing results.

Eventually Vicross concocted techniques capable of partially controlling wild surges. She was able to enchant this circlet to reduce wild surge probability—and to minimize negative results.

Cornered countless times, Niu was always successful in using this dagger to escape. In the end, it wasn't an enemy or vengeful victim that felled Niu, but rather old age.

Duration: 3 rounds

Area of Effect: The caster

Cloak of Fear bestows the caster with an aura of fear in a 5-ft. radius. All creatures that enter the cloak's area of effect must make a Save vs. Spell or flee in panic for 3 rounds. The aura does not affect undead creatures.~

@6650 = ~Find Familiar
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: n/a
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the caster must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A Mage has 12 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 9 Hit Points, so the caster gets a bonus of 4 Hit Points. The caster now has 16 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the caster loses those 4 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 12), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 9 damage.

Here is a list of the familiars that the player receives according to alignment:

@6780 = ~This ring is relatively unadorned, but the vile magic within radiates intense evil. Indeed, its creator, Kangaxx, was no less evil himself, even before millennia of undeath honed his power. It is said that a cadre of Netherese mages fought and imprisoned the demilich once, but being unable to truly destroy him, they became liches themselves to stand guard over his remains. The construction of the ring may have led to their enmity, as each of the gem's nine facets was supposedly empowered by sacrifice and death.

@6800 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but for being an idiot. As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a treant was in the first place, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance."

It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.

As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt," "Oh yeah! Got 'im good," and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

@6870 = ~Dragonslayer: Peridan
Few dare to create items such as this, for who does not fear the wrath of dragons, and what action would more tempt their reckoning?
