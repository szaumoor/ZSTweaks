(Abjuration, Evocation)

Level: 3
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

A Glyph of Warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any creature violating the warded area is subject to the magic it stores, although a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell enables the creature to take only half of the damage. When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When the glyph is activated, it deals 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the caster, up to 20d4.~

@5010 = ~Bless
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Sphere: All
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Upon uttering the Bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack and damage rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 40 ft.) the spell will be cast. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15-ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effects; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~

@5020 = ~Hold Person
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 2
Sphere: Charm
Range: 35 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemy within 4 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. This includes: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 4 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who Save vs. Spell at -1 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

@5030 = ~Finger of Death
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Finger of Death spell snuffs out the victim's life force. The caster points <PRO_HISHER> finger at the victim after the incantation is complete, effectively ripping the life out of its body unless a Save vs. Spell is made with a -2 penalty. A creature successfully making the Saving Throw still receives 2d8 points of damage + 1 per level of the caster.~


@5040 = ~Meteor Swarm
(Evocation)

Level: 9
Range: 270 ft.
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When the caster utters the words to this powerful spell, <PRO_HESHE> calls upon powerful forces indeed. These forces pull down meteors from above, hurling them randomly at anyone in the area of effect. Anyone caught in the destructive path of the meteors—whether friend or foe—will suffer 2d8 points of damage plus 1 per level of the caster (i.e. 2d10 + 1/level) with no Saving Throw or Magic Resistance check allowed to resist it. The caster is well advised to be careful in <PRO_HISHER> use of this spell.~

@5050 = ~Horror
(Enchantment)

Level: 2
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

(Alteration, Evocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Casting a Goodberry spell creates 6 magical berries that the caster can carry with <PRO_HIMHER>. Each berry restores 2d4 Hit Points when eaten and grant a slow regeneration of 1 HP per turn for 8 hours.~

@5070 = ~Created by the Goodberry spell, these simple-looking blueberries will heal 2d4 points of damage for each handful of berries eaten and help the body heal faster for 8 hours.

STATISTICS:

@5080 = ~Negative Plane Protection
(Abjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Protection, Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell affords the caster or the touched creature partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy Plane connections (such as vampires), and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The Negative Plane Protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy Plane, possibly offsetting the effects of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is protected against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell. The protected creature suffers only normal Hit Point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience. This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy Plane.~

@5090 = ~Earthquake
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 360 ft.
Duration: 3 tremors
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, a local tremor of fairly high strength rips the ground. The shock is over in several rounds. The earthquake affects all creatures in its area of effect except the caster and <HISHER> party. There are 3 tremors that are caused by the earthquake:

 1st: All creatures affected take 6d6 points of damage and fall to the ground for 4 rounds. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -6 penalty halves the damage and negates the fall.
 2nd: All creatures affected take 3d6 points of damage. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty halves the damage.
 3rd: All creatures affected take 2d6 points of damage. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell halves the damage.

Additionally, earth elementals dislike mere mortals toying with the land and there is a small chance that casting this spell will cause an earth elemental to appear and attack the party.~

@5100 = ~Entangle
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Sphere: Plant
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of this spell, the caster is able to cause plants in the area of effect to entangle creatures within the area. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about the creatures, holding them fast. Once per round, a creature can attempt to save vs. Spell with a +2 bonus to avoid entanglement. The difficulty of the saving throw improves by 1 at level 5 and every fifth level thereafter.  An entangled creature can still attack, but receives a -2 penalty to its Armor Class.~

@5110 = ~Poison
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: 15 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

Through this spell, the caster can poison victims who fail their Saving Throw vs. Poison. The damage inflicted depends on the level of the caster as detailed below:
 7–9th level: 2d8 + 2/round
 10–12th level: 3d8 + 3/round
 13–14th level: 4d8 + 4/round
 15–16th level: 6d8 + 5/round
 17+ level: 8d8 + 6/round
Those who make their Saving Throws only take half of the initial damage, and are unaffected by the poison damage per round.~

@5120 = ~Holy Power
(Evocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Through this spell, the caster imbues <PRO_HIMHER>self with the strength and skill of a Fighter of the same level. The priest's Strength score is set to 18/00—even if it is normally higher—<PRO_HISHER> THAC0 becomes that of a Fighter of the same level, gains 1/2 APR at level 7 and another one at level 13, and <PRO_HESHE> gains 1 temporary Hit Point per level. This will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@5130 = ~Tenser's Transformation
(Alteration)

Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power, for when the wizard casts the spell, <PRO_HESHE> undergoes a startling transformation. The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic proportions, and <PRO_HESHE> becomes a formidable fighting machine.

The spell causes the caster to become a berserk Fighter: <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points double, and all damage <PRO_HESHE> sustains is first detracted from this magically-gained life; <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class gains a +4 bonus up to a maximum Armor Class of -10; and all <PRO_HISHER> attacks are made as though <PRO_HESHE> were a Fighter of the same level (i.e. the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved to Fighters, and extra attacks are granted). Each attack also receives a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@5140 = ~Iron Skins
(Alteration)

Sphere: Elemental
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Druid casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the Druid in no way. The effect of this is to protect the Druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level Druid would receive 5 skins. For each skin the Druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level Druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER> but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the Druid until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell's duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the Druid from any area attacks such as Fireball; however, it will protect <PRO_HIMHER> from physical magical attacks such as Magic Missile.~

@5150 = ~Fire Seeds
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 6
Sphere: Elemental
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: 1/2

Casting the Fire Seed spell creates 10 fire seeds that will appear in the caster's inventory. The seeds will remain in existence for 3 turns after the spell is cast. If they are thrown at an enemy, a fireball will ensue, causing 3d8+5 points of damage to all within a 7-ft. radius unless they make a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage. These seeds are thrown with a THAC0 bonus of +2 and are considered +2 weapons for the purposes of what they can hit.~

@5160 = ~Created by the Fire Seeds spell. When thrown at opponents, they explode into small fireballs that do 3d8+5 points of damage to everyone within a 7-ft. radius.

STATISTICS:

THAC0: +2
Damage: 3d8+5 (Save vs. Spell for half)

Weight: 0~

@5170 = ~Nature's Beauty
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 7
Sphere: Elemental
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

When this spell is cast, the caster appears to undergo a remarkable transformation. The caster becomes the very ideal of beauty: For a male, this is usually a nymph; for a female, it varies. As with a nymph, anyone viewing the disguised caster must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with +2 bonus or die of longing for the denied illusion. Even if the Saving Throw is successful, hapless viewers of the transformed Druid are all instantly smitten with permanent blindness (until dispelled). The transformation is instantaneous, but lasts only seconds, affecting those near the caster (excluding fellow party members).~

@5180 = ~Confusion
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 7
Sphere: Chaos
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes confusion in one or more enemy creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All enemy creatures within the area of effect are allowed Saving Throws vs. Spell with a -4 penalty. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Those who fail their Saving Throws will either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell.

The spell lasts for 1 round for every two levels of the caster. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.~

@5190 = ~Symbol, Death
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 7
Sphere: Guardian
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Symbol, Death is a powerful enchantment that allows the priest to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until someone comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all those within the area of effect to make a Saving Throw vs. Death or die. Creatures with more than 60 current Hit Points are significantly less likely to be killed, gaining a +6 bonus to their Saving Throw.~

@5200 = ~Symbol, Death
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 8
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Symbol, Death is a powerful enchantment that allows the wizard to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until someone comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all those within the area to make a Save vs. Death or die. Creatures with more than 60 current Hit Points are significantly less likely to be killed, gaining a +6 bonus to their Saving Throw.~

@5210 = ~Ethereal Retribution
(Conjuration)

Level: Quest
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

Ghostly figures called by the Shaman swirl around the battlefield, tormenting the Shaman's adversaries. All enemies within the area of effect take 6d6 points of magic damage per round for the next 3 rounds (no save). In addition, all living enemies (undead and constructs are unaffected) must save vs. Spell or lose 2 points of Strength every round for 5 rounds. The Strength loss is cumulative, but this spell cannot reduce the Strength of a creature below 1.~

@5220 = ~Ray of Enfeeblement
(Necromancy)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard weakens an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim is reduced to a Strength of 5 for the duration of the spell unless a Save vs. Spell is made. This spell does not affect combat bonuses due to magical items, and those conferring increased Strength function normally. However the target receives all of the penalties for a 5 Strength such as attack and damage penalties as well as lower weight allowance.~

@5230 = ~Death Fog
(Evocation)

Level: 6
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

The casting of a Death Fog spell creates an area of solid fog that has the additional property of being highly acidic. All animal life not immune to acid suffers 1d8+8 points of damage for each round they are exposed to the vapors of the Death Fog. Death Fog will also instantly kill all summoned creatures, regardless of their Hit Dice and immunities.~

@5240 = ~Contagion
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes a major disease and weakness in a creature. The afflicted individual is immediately stricken with painful and distracting symptoms: boils, blotches, lesions, seeping abscesses, and so on. Strength and Dexterity scores are reduced by 4. The afflicted character is also Slowed. These effects persist until the character receives a Cure Disease spell.~

@5250 = ~Energy Drain
(Necromancy)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining <PRO_HIMHER> of 6 levels of experience. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.~

Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerûn, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten so that the sword itself shall never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today. It is infused with the very essence of virtue and requires as much from any Paladin who would hope to wield it. The evils of the realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease. Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of chaos and evil, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.

Now combined with the Eye of Tyr, even such powerful weapon was made even greater.

Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed; though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orcs called this time the "Year of Pushing Too Far."

This dark, two-handed sword radiates evil from a distance. The weapon is not just unholy, but unearthly as well. Long thought to be just a myth, the blade's infamy pervades the accounts of learned bards and ancient sages. According to these accounts, the githyanki wizard-smith Ir'mlar forged the blade many centuries ago in dark caverns deep beneath Tu'narath. This githyanki city floats in the Astral Plane upon the petrified corpse of a dead god known only as "the One in the Void." To craft the sword, Ir'mlar allegedly used the One's own bones, which consist of a metallic substance unknown on the Prime Material Plane. The smith then imbued the weapon with a fiendish entity whom some seers claim was a mighty prince of the lower plane of Carceri. Others claim the sword contains the One in the Void's own spirit, banished within the blade for crimes committed against other gods in past ages. In any case, Ir'revrykal possesses such an enmity against good that only blackguards committed to evil may wield it. Circular runes etched on the blade proclaim its name in ancient tir'su, the githyanki language. The runes translate roughly as "Pain-Servant."

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

A Grease spell covers a material surface with a slippery, highly flamable layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell at +2 or slip and slide, unable to move effectively (80% slower). Those who successfully save can move, albeit slowly (25% slower), for the rest of the round (but will need to save vs. Spell again the following round). Regardless of whether they save against the effect or not, the oil will make them take 25% more fire damage for 1 round due to the volatile nature of the oils. Those who remain in the area are allowed a Saving Throw each round until they escape the area.

Because this spell effectively simply conjures plain grease, it's not affected by Magic Resistance.~

An ambitious young wild mage named Vicross's fear of discovery and desire to master her capricious magic were so great that she managed to conceal her status and rise through the Red Wizard hierarchy. She became an autharch for Aznar Thrul, the tharchion of Priador. In this position, she created the Order of Eight Staves, designed to study wild magic. For years, Vicross and her underlings hunted and captured wild mages across Faerûn, performing a variety of tests on their prisoners, collecting and analyzing results.

Eventually Vicross concocted techniques capable of partially controlling wild surges. She was able to enchant this circlet to reduce wild surge probability—and to minimize negative results. Fearful of her ever suspicious fellow Red Wizards, she wore it at all times, to keep her wild magic from betraying her.

If the caster successfully hits with the flame blade in melee combat, the creature struck suffers 1d4 points of slashing damage, plus an additional 1d2+4 points of fire damage. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 4
Sphere: Charm
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Neg.

Cloak of Fear bestows the caster with an aura of fear in a 5-ft. radius. All creatures that enter the cloak's area of effect must make a Save vs. Spell or flee in panic for 3 rounds. The aura does not affect undead creatures.~

@6650 = ~Find Familiar
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: n/a
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist.)

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the caster must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A Mage has 12 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 9 Hit Points, so the caster gets a bonus of 4 Hit Points. The caster now has 16 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the caster loses those 4 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 12), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 9 damage.

Here is a list of the familiars that the player receives according to alignment:

@6700 = ~Beroalf was a barbarian who traveled from the cold north in search of adventure. He sought treasures and glory, but soon all he wanted were companions to share in the excitement of battle, much like those he had left behind in his faraway village. Unfortunately, his coarse remarks and rudimentary hygiene repelled most travelers he met, until he expressed his thoughts to a sympathetic mage. The mage, for a price, constructed Ras, the dancing blade. Though not quite what Beroalf had in mind, he was thrilled nonetheless and wielded the sword for many years. How they were ultimately separated is not known.

Apart from the sword's regular properties, it seemingly reacts of its own volition when it's wielded in combat by subtly moving on its own in ways that promote accuracy and deflection in combat.

@6800 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but for being an idiot. As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a treant was in the first place, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance."

It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.

As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt," "Oh yeah! Got 'im good," and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

@6950 = ~Flesh to Stone
(Alteration)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell turns flesh of any sort to stone. All possessions on the person of the creature likewise turn to stone. The intended subject of the spell receives a Saving Throw vs. Petrification to avoid the effect. If a statue created by this spell is subjected to attacks of any sort, it will shatter into tiny pieces, making it impossible for the creature to be returned to flesh. The reverse of this spell may be cast upon the victim in order to restore life, but this is the only way.~

@6960 = ~This glittering golden crown looks impressive, but its substance is base fool's gold and the "gems" set around it are bits of colored glass.

@6981 = ~This blade appears smooth and whole at first glance, but on closer examination, its surface is made of thousands of tiny overlapping scales. When the sword is used to stab a target unawares, scales break off and lodge in the wound, irritating the victim and draining their strength.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature

(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Summoning
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

As the Shaman casts this spell, energies gather together from the spirit world and form a pale blue sphere. The Shaman can throw the sphere so that it explodes into a burst of ghostly, azure flames, which deliver 1d4+1 points of magic damage per level of the Shaman (up to a maximum of 12d4+12). There is also a 33% chance that every enemy within the area of effect will be afflicted by the Doom spell (-2 penalty to Saving Throws and attack rolls for 1 turn). A successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage, but not the Doom effect. Spirits, fey creatures, elementals, and spectral undead take double damage.~

@7010 = ~Eagle Bow: Protector of the Dryads
In order to protect their community from an encroaching orc logging encampment, the hero Hannable the White was given this magnificent bow by the dryads of Gulthmere Forest. A deadly confrontation followed when the loggers dared to try to cut down a great oak tree, nearly killing the dryad linked to it. With the help of powerful forest animals, Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood. The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest. Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily... nay, VERY happily ever after!

As a reward, his patron granted him this terrifying mask. The silver mask has a grotesque face distorted into a grimace.

Old tales say that during one of her missions, in the innermost sanctum of a long-forgotten temple found deep within the mountains, she discovered this blade, enshrined upon an ornate pedestal. As she reached out to touch it, the sword resonated with a soft whisper, as if acknowledging her presence.

Allegedly, this event was what awakened the blade's true powers, and it was this haunting whisper what earned the weapon its name, symbolizing the deep bond between the warrior and her blade. Many of her exploits were conducted using this blade.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a giant disembodied hand to squeeze and constrict the target once per round for up to 4 rounds. It initially smashes the target for 4d6+6 crushing damage with no save, and the target is held. In the second round, the target can save vs. Paralysis at -4 to escape. If they fail to save, the hand does 6d6+4 crushing damage. The following round, the target can save vs. Paralysis at -2. If they make the save, they are free to move, if they fail, the spell does 8d6+2 crushing damage and holds them for 2 rounds. After the 4th round, the spell is finished. Magic Resistance will not stop the spell.~

Level: 9
Range: 35 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the priest channels a bolt of Positive Energy against the target. No attack roll is needed. Creatures struck suffer varying damage, depending on their plane of origin:

Sphere: Combat, Necromantic
Level: 6
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell affects a single living creature. Dolorous Decay is a rotting and withering of the body that spreads throughout the afflicted creature quickly.

Furthermore, if the target fails a Saving Throw vs. Poison with a -3 penalty, <PRO_HESHE> will suffer 1 point of damage per second for 1 turn, and suffer a -2 penalty to THAC0, Damage, and AC, and will suffer 8% extra physical damage for that duration.~

(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Weather
Range: 80 ft.
Duration: 1 round/4 levels
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 360-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

Call Lightning must be cast outside; otherwise, it will not work, and the spell is wasted. The caster is able to beckon the skies to throw one bolt of lightning per round. The spell has a duration of 1 round every 4 levels of the caster. Each bolt causes 2d6+1 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d6+1 points per level of the caster, up to level 18 (20d6+20). At level 19 and 20, the damage improves additively by 2 and 3, respectively, ending with a maximum damage of 20d6+25. Thus, an 8th-level caster will call down two bolts, each dealing 10d6+10 points of electrical damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at any of the priest's enemies. The first enemy struck by the lightning will be the enemy targeted. After that, any enemy (but no allies) may be struck by the ensuing lightning storm.

Since the electrical damage comes from the skies in a natural way, Magic Resistance does not affect this spell.~

(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

A Fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it—1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the caster, up to a maximum of 10d6. After level 10, an extra point of fire damage is added per level until level 20 (maximum of 10d6+10). The wizard points <PRO_HISHER> finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the Fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their Saving Throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half.~

(Evocation)

Level: 5

A Sunfire is like a Fireball—an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the caster: 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, which reaches 10d6 at level 10, and then increases by 1d6+1 up to level 15 (15d6+5), and then increases again by +2 until level 20 (maximum of 15d6+15). The wizard gestures with <PRO_HISHER> hand, and the entire area around <PRO_HIMHER> erupts in flames, striking everyone except the caster <PRO_HIMHER>self. Creatures failing their Saving Throws take full damage from the blast; those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each taking half damage.~

This spell creates a Fireball that hovers at a point determined by the caster.

Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful rite shields the Shaman from death for 24 hours or until discharged. While under the protection of this rite, the Shaman is immune to all forms of death magic and vorpal hits. In addition, if the Shaman is reduced below 10% Hit Points and the rite is active, the Shaman instantly receives the benefit of a Heal spell. The rite's protection (including the immunity to death) is completely discharged once the Heal spell is triggered. Further applications of the rite will not stack in any way but replace the previous one.

Requires: Spirit Form~

@7540 = ~One of many created in the name of the mage who first discovered how to enchant a blade in this manner, this was the weapon of the outlaw Garno, and many a cleric died at its edge. Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar and spent his life seeking revenge. Despite his focused hatred of the devout, it is thought that one of the gods of chaos had a hand in Garno's acquisition of this sword, delighting in the havoc that followed the young man.

This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of spell levels equal to the level of the caster. This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest, as well as area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud. As long as the spell is cast directly at the priest, it will be absorbed provided that there are spell levels remaining. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.~

@7560 = ~The benefits inherent in this sword are plain to see: It is exceptionally accurate, and a lick of flame follows every blow, searing the target in addition to the normal damage received, which may linger on the target, causing them to burn even more.

@7710 = ~Trying to profit from the strength of greater beings, many years ago the mage Ullion founded a dragon-worshipping cult under the moniker "Son of Drago." Attracting followers with promises of conquest, he sought to secure his authority by enchanting this symbolic weapon for his bodyguard, Jaramor Bold. When the Dragon's Breath strikes an opponent, it releases the harsh flames of a red dragon, the poisonous vapor of the green dragon, the blue dragon's lightning bolt, a spray of a black dragon's acid, and the white dragon's penetrating cold. Unfortunately, Ullion was the first to feel its effects, slain by the ambitious Jaramor, who sought to rule. There was no real power to be had without the mage, so the entire organization soon collapsed on itself.

@7720 = ~Though once a simple halberd, this weapon spent many hundreds of years in a tomb next to the soul phylactery of a powerful lich. The creature was eventually erased from existence, purportedly by another of its kind, but such close proximity to that concentrated evil has imbued this blade with the very essence of night and the chill of darkness, energy that becomes deadly in combat. It is a foul weapon, and a warrior should use it with caution.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Like the deathly touch of shadows, every hit has a 25% chance of reducing the target's Strength by 2 for 5 rounds. If the target is already at a Strength of 2, the attack drains Constitution instead.

@7740 = ~Kazgaroth was an aspect of Bhaal who was a powerful, intelligent, shapeshifting evil beast opposed to the balance and the influence of the Earthmother on the Moonshae Isles. This horn is thought to be made from one its tusks. When blown upon, no sound issues from the horn. Instead, the user of the horn is encased in a globe of power for a short duration. The bubble greatly increases the user's magical defenses and saving throws, as well as partially deflecting incoming physical attacks. The horn draws from the life force of the user every time it is used.

// +5 flail of the ages
@7760 = ~This flail has been in the care of Lord de'Arnise for some time, a relic of his adventuring youth. It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord de'Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiated when compiled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt, the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity for magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, "losing" it again and again. Powerful items gravitate toward powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

With the addition of the fifth and final head to this weapon created by the evil rakshasa race, the true potential of the Flail of Ages is finally realized.

@7790 = ~Sun Soulbeam
The character emits a dazzling burst of light that strikes at all other creatures within a 15-ft. radius. The Sun Soulbeam does not automatically hit all targets, but makes a melee attack using the character's current THAC0 (+3 to hit vs. undead). Struck creatures suffer 9d6 points of fire damage (12d6+3 if undead), unless they Save vs. Spell for half. In addition, all creatures except the character must Save vs. Spell or be blinded for 2 hours.~

@7800 = ~Sun Soulray
The character projects a blast of light from <PRO_HISHER> open palm, dealing 1d8 fire damage for every 2 caster levels (up to a maximum of 5d8 damage) to a single target. Undead creatures take an additional 6 points of damage (which increases by 2 every 2 caster levels). There is no Saving Throw against this ability.~


@7810 = ~The provenance of this dark purple robe has been lost in the mists of history, but a faint odor of stale magic lingers in the air around the threadbare garment. The one who wore it was clearly no stranger to the Weave. Closely examining the robe, you are able to pick out a stylized flame design woven into the fabric. It seems likely the intricate pattern was always subtle, but even were that not true, countless years of wear have rendered the flames all but invisible.

@7820 = ~This ring, designed for the hero Zachiira, is engraved with holy symbols. When Zachiira requested aid from King Strohm III, it was the king’s royal advisor, the great and powerful Theurgist Karlash Arnostognas, who made this item, in the hope that it would aid the hero in her battle against a demon vampire. Zachiira survived the encounter, but sadly her triumphal return was met with rather less celebration and rather more grief, as the good king was already dead when she arrived. Zachiira laid the holy artifact at the entrance to the king’s tomb, and it was there the relic was discovered by wandering thrill-seekers.

@7850 = ~The rhino beetle's carapace makes a most effective shield provided one can survive long enough to pry a piece off the creature.

@7860 = ~This shield was carried by a mercenary working with the Order of the Steel Fang. The warriors of the order were impressed with the mercenary's tenacity and courage. She charged into battle without hesitation and seemed to fight all the harder when she was wounded. When their quest was completed, the Order of the Steel Fang gifted a battleaxe to the mercenary as thanks for her service. In turn she gave the order her shield as a sign of respect. The shield stayed in the order for years until it was lost on a battlefield.

@7870 = ~Legend has it that this elegant curving blade was forged deep beneath the sea by merfolk and its hilt bound in enchanted eelskin. The truth of the matter is more mundane. The blade was crafted in Iriaebor and given to a mercenary commander who protected cargo barges moving up and down the river Chionthar. Still, it is a finely made and serviceable weapon.

@7880 = ~This wakizashi is finely made, but gaudy false gems have been glued on to its hilt. The weapon was procured by Bartleby, a local thug whose obsession with the continent of Kara-Tur has made him one of the most obnoxious mercenaries in the local taverns. He rambles for hours on how different the foreign culture is to that of the Sword Coast and prides himself on being a "city samurai," a title that is as offensive as it is undeserved.

@7900 = ~This much-used but still razor-sharp blade was found in the chest of Ophyllis, a treasurer of the Ducal Palace in Baldur's Gate. While his position ensured that Ophyllis possessed many chests, he only used one to house his lungs, and it was in this particular chest the sword was placed. Ophyllis died an agonized, painful death, but not before he gave the sword to a <PRO_MANWOMAN> to whom he owed a deep personal debt. His mournful voice can still be heard by those who wield the blade.

@8010 = ~The Burning Earth +2~
@8011 = ~Flame Tongue +2: The Burning Earth
There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough—it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself—but whomever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for <PRO_HIMHER>... or any other humanoid.
