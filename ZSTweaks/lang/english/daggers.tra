@6560 = ~This dagger is made entirely from a single cut of jade and has an edge suitable for splitting hairs. A complex ornamental design can be seen on either side, although their historical or cultural significance has long since been forgotten.

The Jade Fang was the weapon of choice for famed Shou Lung thief Niu Weidan, who would use the dagger to immobilize his opponents before draining them of their life force to reinforce his own. Cornered countless times, Niu was always successful in using this dagger to escape. In the end, it wasn't an enemy or vengeful victim that felled Niu, but rather old age. The blade was passed down through his family as an heirloom and did not see use as a combat weapon from that point onward.

@6580 = ~Most who take up the trade of murder for hire do so for reasons other than personal pleasure, but not so the Lady Demarche. She took special pleasure in the torture of her targets... which is why she made this dagger. With but one touch of its polished blade, an opponent was rendered immobile, incapable of so much as screaming, yet the victim could watch and feel all that happened to them. While her opponent was thus held, the Lady would slowly bleed them, sometimes taking several hours before allowing her subject to succumb to the final agony of death. The Lady finally fell victim to her own evil; disarmed by a rival and struck by her own stiletto, her fate was soon sealed.
