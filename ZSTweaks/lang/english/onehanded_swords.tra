He sought treasures and glory, but soon all he wanted were companions to share in the excitement of battle, much like those he had left behind in his faraway village.

Though much of her early life is largely unknown, it is said she was trained as a shadowdancer, quickly ascending to become one of the most accomplished members of her order.

Old tales recount that, during a mission deep in the heart of a forgotten mountain temple, Kachiko came upon this blade resting atop an ornate pedestal. As her hand closed around the hilt, the sword resonated with a soft whisper, as if acknowledging her presence.

There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough—it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself—but whoever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for <PRO_HIMHER>... or any other humanoid.

@50080 = ~This weapon was commissioned by <CHARNAME>, and combines the power of three powerful weapons, Rashad's Talon, Water's Edge, and Adjatha the Drinker, making it a formidable weapon that combines and improves the powers of all three. In addition, however, its mastery over water protects the user from the harmful effects of Horrid Wilting. Most uniquely, the liquid nature of the blade allows it to extend and splash during combat, improving the strike range granted by the weapon to a range of that of two-handed swords.

– Immunity to Horrid Wilting
