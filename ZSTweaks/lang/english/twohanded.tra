@6080 = ~The Holy Avenger: Carsomyr
Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerûn, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten so that the sword itself shall never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today. It is infused with the very essence of virtue and requires as much from any Paladin who would hope to wield it. The evils of the realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease. Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.

This dark, two-handed sword radiates evil from a distance. The weapon is not just unholy, but unearthly as well. Long thought to be just a myth, the blade's infamy pervades the accounts of learned bards and ancient sages. According to these accounts, the githyanki wizard-smith Ir'mlar forged the blade many centuries ago in dark caverns deep beneath Tu'narath. This githyanki city floats in the Astral Plane upon the petrified corpse of a dead god known only as "the One in the Void." To craft the sword, Ir'mlar allegedly used the One's own bones, which consist of a metallic substance unknown on the Prime Material Plane. The smith then imbued the weapon with a fiendish entity whom some seers claim was a mighty prince of the lower plane of Carceri. Others claim the sword contains the One in the Void's own spirit, banished within the blade for crimes committed against other gods in past ages. In any case, Ir'revrykal possesses such an enmity against good that only blackguards committed to evil may wield it. Circular runes etched on the blade proclaim its name in ancient tir'su, the githyanki language. The runes translate roughly as "Pain-Servant."

@6800 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but for being an idiot. As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a treant was in the first place, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance."

It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.

As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt," "Oh yeah! Got 'im good," and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

@7691 = ~Illithid destroyed~

@7700 = ~This was the weapon of Thorvin Dukal, one of seven self-proclaimed Dragonslayers who spent years railing against what they called "an insidious dragon infestation that threatened Faerûn." Thorvin had this weapon enchanted at great expense and used it on many occasions, though of dragons only a single white has fallen to it. The Dragonslayers met their match in a cantankerous ancient red who slew the entire group in an epic battle. This weapon did not end up in the beast's hoard, however, as the creature returned to its lair to recuperate and when it emerged, the field of combat was well scavenged.

@7710 = ~Trying to profit from the strength of greater beings, many years ago the mage Ullion founded a dragon-worshiping cult under the moniker "Son of Drago." Attracting followers with promises of conquest, he sought to secure his authority by enchanting this symbolic weapon for his bodyguard, Jaramor Bold. When the Dragon's Breath strikes an opponent, it releases the harsh flames of a red dragon, the poisonous vapor of the green dragon, the blue dragon's lightning bolt, a spray of a black dragon's acid, and the white dragon's penetrating cold. Unfortunately, Ullion was the first to feel its effects, slain by the ambitious Jaramor, who sought to rule. There was no real power to be had without the mage, so the entire organization soon collapsed on itself.

@7720 = ~Though once a simple halberd, this weapon spent many hundreds of years in a tomb next to the soul phylactery of a powerful lich. The creature was eventually erased from existence, purportedly by another of its kind, but such close proximity to that concentrated evil has imbued this blade with the very essence of night and the chill of darkness, energy that becomes deadly in combat. It is a foul weapon, and a warrior should use it with caution.

STATISTICS:

Combat abilities:
– Like the touch of shadows, every hit has a 25% chance of reducing the target's Strength by 2 for 5 rounds. If the target has already less than 3 Strength, the attack drains Constitution instead
– If the target fails to save vs. Death, the essence of undeath in this weapon unleashes extra 1d6 cold damage

@8040 = ~Aule's Staff +3~
@8041 = ~This finely crafted staff was among the spoils taken from the invaders of Durlag's Tower. It is very deadly in combat, and was apparently the property of a spellcaster that enjoyed standing on the front lines. It appears to have a core of iron, yet it is comparable in weight to a normal weapon of its type. Part of the enchantment seems to come from the hide that strengthens the grip: Leather no doubt made from a battle-ready creature of some sort. With the tastes and inclinations of the attackers of the tower well documented, the hide could be almost anything... or anyone.

@8140 = ~Taking the blood-soaked shaft of this weapon in hand brings a sudden chill along your spine. The origins of this gruesome halberd are unknown, though the very sight of it has been know to strike terror into the heart of an opponent.

Now combined with the Serpent Shaft, this dark halberd has the ability to slay an opponent with a single blow—unless they can survive the sudden loss of their head.

@8610 = ~The Impaler has a palpable aura of magic that hints at the vicious nature of the weapon and why it has been a favorite of several powerful orc chieftains in the past. When a victim is struck they are, as one would guess, very nearly impaled, run through as the massive enchantment does its dirty work.

  – Fiends: 95%
  – Liches and demiliches: 80%
  – Vampires and vampyres: 50%
  – Spectres, ghosts, and other spectral creatures: 35%
  – Mummies and revenants: 20%

  – Other lesser undead creatures such as Skeletons, Shadows, and Ghouls have no chance of resisting it and must therefore save against it every time~

@50100 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but for being an idiot. As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a treant was in the first place, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance."

Lilarcor is not quite as lovable (or annoying, depending on your viewpoint) as it was before <CHARNAME> had it upgraded. When the Mind Flayer Control Circlet was embedded in its hilt, Lilarcor seemed to lose the ability to consciously converse with those nearby and was reduced to making occasional quips. However, Lilarcor's peculiar intelligence (or lack thereof) now serves as a boon (or a blight) to the wielder: the one holding Lilarcor cannot have its intelligence adjusted for any reason. This protects against the intelligence drain associated with the illithids' brain-devouring attack, and the beneficial effects of a potion of Genius.

@50130 = ~Soul Reaver +6: Unholy Avenger
The powerful Soul Reaver blade has been reforged under the dark guidance of <CHARNAME>. The holy essence of Carsomyr was perverted to help create this abhorrent monstrosity. Soul Reaver is a tool of incredible power and incredible evil. Those who pick it up rarely put it down while still living.
