### Hawksight +2

---
Long ago, the famous elven sentinel Arannis Alderlight had this sword forged to help him defend against the forces plotting against his kingdom. The arcane smiths imbued it with the essence of a hawk, and with this blade, Arannis became a force to be reckoned with, able to strike down foes before they could act.

After Arannis faded into legend, Hawksight continued to pass through the hands of other warriors. Each bearer inherited a fragment of Arannis's vigilant spirit, transforming them into ever-vigilant sentinels, ensuring no threat went unseen and no strike landed untrue.
