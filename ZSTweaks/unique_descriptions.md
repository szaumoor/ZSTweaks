### Hawksight +2

---

Long ago, the famous elven sentinel Arannis Alderlight had this sword forged to help him defend against the forces plotting against his kingdom. The arcane smiths imbued it with the essence of a hawk, and with this blade, Arannis became a force to be reckoned with, able to strike down foes before they could act.

After Arannis faded into legend, Hawksight continued to pass through the hands of other warriors. Each bearer inherited a fragment of Arannis's vigilant spirit, transforming them into ever-vigilant sentinels, ensuring no threat went unseen and no strike landed untrue.

### Kachiko's Whisper +3

---
Kachiko's Whisper
This wakizashi was the favored weapon of a female warrior named Kachiko. She hailed from the far eastern lands in Kara-Tur, and while her early life is largely unknown, it is believed she was trained as a shadowdancer, where she was able to shine as one of the most skilled of her order.

Old tales say that during one of her missions, in the innermost sanctum of a long-forgotten temple found deep within the mountains, she discovered this blade, enshrined upon an ornate pedestal. As she reached out to touch it, the sword resonated with a soft whisper, as if acknowledging her presence.

Allegedly, this event was what awakened the blade's true powers, and it was this haunting whisper what earned the weapon its name, symbolizing the deep bond between the warrior and her blade. Many of her exploits were conducted using this blade.
