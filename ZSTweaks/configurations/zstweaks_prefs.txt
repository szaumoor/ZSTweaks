// Here you can adjust values to apply different changes to components without having to deal with set installation options in the Weidu installer. Do not remove quotation marks when changing values.

// All options that are about "allowing" a tweak or not follow the binary format of "1" (true) to allow the tweak during installation time, and "0" (false) to not allow. Change it to your preferences according to that. If the values have a different meaning, it will be noted.
